# Azeez Daoud (azeezd) Task 8 

## `high-to-low`
The `multiplication.asm` includes `factorial` and `multiply` as global routines and has a `main` routines for testing. The `main` routine is an infinite loop which asks the user for input integer to calculate factorial of. If `-1` is inputted, the program terminates. The testing has no error checking.

## `sieve`
The `sieve.asm` contains assembly code that disassembled my mentality. It is based on a translation from a `C` code (I found that the easiest way to write Assembly). That is why a lot of the comments are "`C`-like".
